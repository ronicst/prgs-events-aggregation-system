Improvement summary
1. Validation of the field’s size is missing and it’s possible to use too long strings.
—-----------------------
2. API validations are not consistent - different validations are implemented for the same field e.g. email
—-----------------------
3. The error handle is not consistent, once the appropriate error message is implemented, further ways the error is “Unexpected error” for similar fields e.g. email, date
—-----------------------
4. Address the typos

Bug list

The bugs are mentioned in the test code to identify which test detect it.

1. EnvironmentTests.EnvironmentSupportedEventsType(): 
Current: FileUpload definition is missing but it’s listed in enum EventType, but there isn’t Dto
Expected: the same event types to be defined without skiping one of them
—-----------------------
2. EnvironmentSupportedEventsType:
Current: InvoiceCreated definition is listed only in the EnvironmentController, but it’s missing in events type and there isn’t any Dto for it. It’s listed in the response body of the swagger. 
Expected: the same event types to be defined without skiping one of them
—-----------------------
3. DeleteUserNegative("invalid_email"):
Current: Delete request: there isn’t validation that the email is the correct form. It fails only if the query parameter is empty.
Expected: To have email format validation.
—-----------------------
4. Current: The FileDownload POST request accepts the date in the future. There isn’t date accuracy validation. This is a valid payload:
{"Id":"2fd7fd4d-8ee6-ee11-a8f8-f48e38cc0ecd","Date":"3024-03-27T18:03:33","FileName":"myfile.exe","FileLenght":5656}

—-----------------------
5. EventsRequiredData("2fd7fd4d-8ee6-ee11-a8f8-f48e38cc0ecd","3/27/3024","","3343")
Current: File name could be a space. Bug: File name is not mandatory field. There isn't any validation for names to be there.
Expected: To have the corresponding validation that the file name is populated
—-----------------------

/environment
/Events
/Users
